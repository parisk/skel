# :zap: skel
A well-structured Git repository skeleton.

This repository should act as a skeleton for creating [well-strucutred repositories](https://stateofprogress.blog/well-structured-repositories-db63864a9a14) (meta!).

I use it as a base when starting a new project and I put it on GitHub to let anyone do so as well.

## :computer: Usage
To start a new well-structured repository:

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/parisk/skel)
2. Change anything that does not match your project's needs (e.g. this README!)
3. Commit your changes
4. _[Optional]_ Vanish the initial commit of this repo by squashing it with your own commit:
```
git rebase -i --root HEAD
```
