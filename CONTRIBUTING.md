# How to contribute

- [Opening issues for bug reports or feature requests](#opening-issues)
- [Contributing code](#contributing-code)

## Opening issues

The preferred way to report bugs or request features is to use
[GitHub issues](http://github.com/parisk/skel/issues). Before
opening an issue, read these pointers.

### Opening issues effectively

- Include information about **the environment in which the problem occurred** (e.g. operating system, browser etc.)

- Mention which release of this repository you're using. Preferably, try also with
  the current HEAD of the master branch, to ensure the problem has not already been
  fixed.

- Mention precisely what went wrong. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the
  exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur.

- Be polite. Issues with an indignant or belligerent tone tend to be moved to the
  bottom of the pile.

## Contributing code

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- Fork [this repo](https://github.com/parisk/skel/)
  ([how to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request ([how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)). Don't put more than one feature/fix in a single pull request.
